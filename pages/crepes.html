    <h3>Desciption of the dish</h3>
    <p>Polish naleśniki (nah-lesh-NEE-kee) are crepe-like pancakes that can be made thin, as in this recipe, or as a thick Polish crepe. They can be enjoyed with either sweet or savory fillings. Every Eastern European country has its version of pancakes or crepes, such as Croatian palačinke, Serbian palacinke, Polish naleśniki,​ and Hungarian palacsinta.

        Once filled and rolled, they can be baked or pan-fried. Another variation is to dip them in beaten egg and breadcrumbs before frying or baking.
        
        Fillings can be as simple as your favorite jam, preserves, or fresh fruit such as berries. Spread them with some Nutella and add banana slices. You can also make a sweet cheese filling using farmer cheese and cream cheese sweetened with sugar and vanilla. You can top them with a fruit compote or a drizzle of chocolate or caramel sauce. Cream cheese also lends itself to savory fillings, especially when flavored with onions, garlic, or herbs.
        
        Enjoy these crepes for breakfast or brunch. Making a platter of them will please your guests.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, for frying, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make a dish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a blender or food processor, combine flour, milk, water, eggs, butter, and salt and process until smooth.</li>
            <li>Transfer batter to a pitcher. Cover the pitcher with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes so liquid can be absorbed by the flour.</li>
            <li>Heat a crepe pan or small skillet over medium heat and lightly coat with butter. Using a 2-ounce ladle, spoon 1 portion of batter into pan.</li>
            <li>Immediately rotate pan and swirl batter until it covers the entire bottom of the pan. Cook until crepe is lightly brown or spotted brown on underside. Flip and cook second side until it is light brown.</li>
            <li>Remove crepe to waxed paper or parchment paper and repeat with remaining batter. You may need to recoat the pan with butter as you cook crepes.</li>
            <li>Place 2 heaping tablespoons of savory filling or sweet filling on each naleśniki. Fold sides in first and then fold bottom up, rolling away from yourself, similar to an egg roll or burrito.</li>
            <li>Filled naleśniki should then be pan-fried in butter over medium-high heat or baked in a buttered casserole dish at 350 F until the filling is set.</li>
        </ol>
